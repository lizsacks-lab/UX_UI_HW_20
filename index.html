    <p class="bold-text">Today, more people spend time watching over the top (OTT) 
      streaming services like Netflix, Hulu and Amazon Prime than
      they do driving a car or talking to friends and family.</p> 
      <p>As of 2019, 65% of 18-34 year-olds were OTT subscribers.</p> 
        On average, users access content on three different devices 
    across three different OTT services. </p><a class=link href="https://www.zype.com/blog/linear-tv-ott-statistics-2019-edition/">(Source: Zype)</a>

    <p class="body_text">As the volume of content offered across all of the separate OTT 
      streaming services continues to grow, our schedules continue to 
      fill and our heightened expectations for truly great content 
      become "off the charts”, the need for TV viewers to find their 
      next favorite show accurately and efficiently is more desired 
      than ever.  </p>

<!-- Research Content -->
<div class="tab-content">
  <div class="tab-pane active" id="interviews" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="interview-tab"><p>Five participants within our target demographic of 18-34 years old who subscribed to multiple streaming platforms were interviewed. Questions focused on the search methods the participants used to find new TV shows and how well those methods ultimately fared for finding programs that fit their preferences.</p>
    <h5 class="bullets">Key Takeaways</h5>
    <div class="tab_quotes bullets">“There are so many choices and new ones coming out every day.”</div>
   <p class="bullets">With limited time and so much content (old and new) people struggle to find that next 
    best choice. And people genuinely want to find the best option for them, not settling for 
    something that doesn’t fully satisfy their desires.</p>
    
    <div class="tab_quotes bullets">“I rarely go into it completely blind.”</div>
    <p class="bullets">Interviewees discussed using multiple resources to search for their next new show. Top 
    methods included: Google searches for review sites, friend/family recommendations, 
    online reviews and social media.</p>
    
    <div class="tab_quotes bullets">“I think [online reviewers] are all just so different.”</div>
    <p class="bullets">Interviewees were pretty divided on whether they read online reviews. Many expressed 
    not finding reviews from people they don’t know personally to be valid. Others said they 
    read them if there are a high enough volume and they could see some consistency in 
    perspective. </p>
    
    <div class="tab_quotes bullets">“I get this empty feeling when I watch a series finale.”</div>
    <p class="bullets">People get emotionally invested and attached to shows that truly resonate with them.</p></div>

  <div class="tab-pane" id="competitors" role="tabpanel" aria-labelledby="competitors-tab">There are a few apps in the marketplace that streamline OTT streaming service viewing. Some specialized in the social component of following friends to chat and receive recommendations on shows, while others built recommendations based upon what a viewer has previously watched. Our team wanted to build an app that could combine all of these features and satisfy all user needs.</div>

      <h3 class="why_mestow mx-auto">The Concept</h3>
      <div class="why_mestow_text mx-auto">
    <p>Mestow accurately recommends shows to viewers across all the OTT 
      streaming services in which they subscribe by having them complete 
      a new user rating of 20 shows upon sign-up. Users are encouraged to 
      rate a range of shows they like/dislike through a 5-star rating process 
      so the app can more accurately recommend shows. Within the app, users can 
      save shows to a watchlist, follow friends and family to view their watchlists, 
      and read online reviews that are exclusively written by Mestow’s loyal users. 
      The app is designed for the discerning TV viewer who wants to filter through 
      to the shows of their specific taste, in the most efficient manner possible.</p>

      <p class="bullets">Adam loves how much quality programming exists today compared to even 5 years ago.
